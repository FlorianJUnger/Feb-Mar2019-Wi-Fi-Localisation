## Wi-Fi Localisation (IoT analytics) - Project Description


**Project Goal:** Investigate the possibility of using "WiFi Access Points" to determine a person's location inside closed facilities. Aim is to determine which machine learning models work best.

**Data characteristics:** We have been provided by a large dataset of observations (WiFi fingerprints) for a multi-building industrial campus. Each observation is associated with a location (building, floor, and location ID). Thereby, we are using the signal intensity recorded from multiple "WiFi Access Points" within the building to determine the person's location.

**Language used:** R programming
